# Solar Power Prediction

## ðŸ“ˆ Objective
Predict solar power generation using environmental variables with high accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Model
Deployed an **XGBoost Regression Model** to predict power output based on features like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more.

## ðŸŽ¨ Deployment
Developed an interactive and stylish **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions, offering an enhanced user experience.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Analyzed **2920 rows** of solar energy data for model training and evaluation.

## ðŸ“… Milestone Timeline
From **EDA to deployment**, the project was completed in under 4 weeks.

Below is a preview of the Solar Power Prediction app:
